Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Autonomous MCP/RAG Multi-Agent Development System
Version: 1.0
Date: June 15, 2025
Status: Ready for Implementation

Executive Summary
Product Vision: Create a self-sustaining, production-ready multi-agent development system that eliminates the "agent stopping" problem through proper MCP coordination, shared RAG memory, and git worktree isolation.

Core Value Proposition: Unlike existing solutions (claude-swarm, claude-flow), this system focuses on simplicity and reliability for Claude Code, achieving 90% reduction in agent failures while maintaining autonomous operation.

Problem Statement
Current Pain Points
Agent Stopping Issue: Multi-agent systems fail when agents lose context or stop unexpectedly

File Conflicts: Multiple agents editing the same files simultaneously cause corruption

Context Loss: No shared memory between agent sessions leads to duplicated work

Complex Setup: Existing solutions require extensive configuration and maintenance

Market Analysis
claude-swarm: Ruby-based, complex YAML hierarchy, 14-file setup

claude-flow: Better UX but lacks true persistence, no RAG integration

claude-squad: Limited documentation, minimal adoption

Gap: No simple, production-ready solution optimized for Claude Code

Product Goals
Primary Objectives
Zero Agent Stopping: Achieve 99%+ uptime for continuous operation

Seamless Coordination: Sub-10-second context synchronization between agents

Simple Setup: 5-minute installation, single-command launch

Superior Performance: 3x faster than manual multi-agent coordination

Success Metrics
Agent uptime > 99%

Context sync latency < 10 seconds

Setup time < 5 minutes

Task completion rate > 90%

Memory retrieval accuracy > 85%

User Personas
Primary User: Solo Developer
Profile: Individual developer working on complex projects

Pain Points: Waiting for single agent to complete tasks, context switching overhead

Goals: Parallel development, faster iteration, maintained quality

Secondary User: Small Development Team
Profile: 2-5 person teams using Claude Code

Pain Points: Coordination between team members' AI agents

Goals: Shared context, consistent workflows, team productivity
