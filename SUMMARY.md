# What We Built: Claude-Code MCP/RAG Task System

## The Evolution

### What You Originally Asked For
An autonomous agent system where 3 agents work together without stopping.

### What We Initially Built (Wrong)
Empty agent shells that did nothing - just infrastructure with no intelligence.

### What We Actually Built (Right)
A task coordination system where Claude-Code instances ARE the intelligence, working together through:
- Shared task management with tags
- MCP tools for coordination
- RAG memory for learning
- Role-based configurations

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Tasks, Not Messages
Instead of complex agent protocols, we use simple tasks with tags:
```javascript
{
  title: "Add dark mode",
  tags: ["FEATURE", "IMPLEMENT"],
  assignedRole: "implementer"
}
```

### 2. Claude as the Brain
- No fake "agent logic"
- Claude instances make decisions
- Roles provide focus and guidelines
- Tools enable action

### 3. Tag-Based Routing
Tasks flow between roles via tags:
- Auditor creates ‚Üí `[IMPLEMENT]`
- Implementer sees ‚Üí claims ‚Üí works
- Implementer creates ‚Üí `[TEST]`
- Validator sees ‚Üí tests

## What Makes This Work

### 1. Real Tools
```javascript
// Task management
create_task()
get_tasks()
claim_task()
update_task()
complete_task()

// Memory & context
rag_store()
rag_query()
update_context()
get_context()
```

### 2. Role Configurations
Each Claude gets:
- Specific tags to watch
- Tools they can use
- Rules to follow
- Initial prompts

### 3. Shared State
- Tasks in shared context
- RAG for patterns/decisions
- No conflicts via task claiming

## Production Readiness

### ‚úÖ What Works
- Task coordination system
- MCP server with all tools
- RAG with real Milvus
- Role configurations
- Shared context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Missing
- Claude CLI integration (assumes `claude` command exists)
- Real embedding models (easy to add)
- Production monitoring
- Test coverage

### üöÄ To Use in Your Project

1. **Ensure Claude CLI is installed** (or modify launcher)
2. **Start Milvus** for RAG
3. **Run MCP server**
4. **Launch Claude instances**
5. **Create tasks** for your project

## The Big Insight

**Agents don't need to be autonomous** - they need to be coordinated. By using Claude as the intelligence and tasks as the coordination mechanism, we get:
- Real problem-solving ability
- Simple, understandable flow
- No complex agent protocols
- Actual useful work

This is what MCP/RAG should be: Tools that enhance Claude's ability to work on complex projects, not fake agents pretending to think.
